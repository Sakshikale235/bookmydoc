Great! Your frontend and backend are now properly integrated. Here's a summary of what we've done:
1.	Confirmed REST framework and CORS headers are installed in your Django backend
2.	Updated CORS settings to allow requests from your Vite development server (port 5173)
3.	Updated the chat interface to communicate with the correct API endpoint
To test the integration:
1.	Start your Django backend:
cd backend
python manage.py runserver
2.	In a new terminal, start your React frontend:
cd react-frontend
npm run dev  # or bun dev if you're using Bun

3.	Access your React app at http://localhost:5173
The Chatbot should now be able to:
1.	Collect user information
2.	Send it to your Django backend
3.	Get an AI-powered response from Gemini
4.	Display the formatted results back to the user
If you encounter any CORS errors in the browser's console, make sure both servers are running and the CORS settings in settings.py are correct. If you get connection errors, verify that:
1.	Django is running on port 8000
2.	The React development server is running on port 5173
3.	The API endpoint URL in the Chatbot component matches your Django URL configuration


Yes, that's correct! It's generally recommended to start the backend (Django) server first, then the frontend (React) server. Here's why:
1.	Backend Dependencies: Your frontend typically makes API calls to the backend. If the backend isn't running when the frontend starts, you'll see connection errors in your application.
2.	Port Availability: Both servers need their own ports:
o	Django typically runs on http://localhost:8000
o	React dev server typically runs on http://localhost:5173 (for Vite) or http://localhost:3000 (for Create React App)
